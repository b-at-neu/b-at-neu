**Northeastern University
Computer Science Major
Concentration in Software Development**

I love coding, theater, and activism. At Northeastern University, I seek out opportunities for me to explore those themes as well as gain new experiences. I am an active member of many student organizations including Student Government Association and Acting Out and love learning new skills and meeting people through the experiences I have.
